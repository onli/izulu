2.0:
    * Moved to working APIs that do not need our own server: brightsky.dev for current
      weather, api.met.no for the forecast and location.services.mozilla.com for the
      geolocation.
      Note: brightsky uses the DWD, a german service. Data outside of Germany is limited.
    * Breaking change: Removed radar feature
    * Breaking change: Removed feature to randomly select an image from a directory
    * Breaking change: Removed feature to randomly select an image from flickr
    * Breaking change: Location now needs to be specified by -l LAT:LON or via the config,
                       the city feature was removed (not supported by mozilla API).
    * Breaking change: Renamed -p/--preview to -f/--forecast
    * Forecast now shows icon for the next 12h interval, not the current, following, ...
      day (data is provided as such from the met.no API)

    * Fix: Move server part to working APIs (mapbox + current darksky url)
    * Always refresh the wallpaper at --interval When --random is set

    * Fix: Switch to DejaVu font to prevent Arch compatibility issue

1.0
    * Remove --woeid parameter. Add --latitude LAT:LON, short form -l, to set the position 
      alternatively to -c. 
    * Removed some weather substates, see the readme or the manual for the new list
    * Added forecast icon for wind and fog
    * Fix izulu by moving to dark sky forecast api via a custom server. Note that 
      the server is heavily rate limited as the api calls per day are very limited, and
      results are cached for half an hour.
0.5:
    * Add --temperature-gravity, --temperature-margin and --compat parameters. This makes
      it possible to use the temperature display with DEs like unity that would otherwise
      cover the default position with a taskbar or similar.

    * Show the day of the forecast icon
    * Exchange forecast icons with http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/

    * Provide Makefile to generate translation, and to ease integration into distros (hopefully)
    * Fix geoip-lookup by changing API to http://freegeoip.net/
    * (Note: Moved project to github)

0.3:

      * Added category windy, including torandoes and hurricanes
    * Disabled swiss weather-radar because the source-image is down

0.2.7:
    * Translated and better formatted osd-messages

    * Show radar and warning-images of your country
    * Automatically select a command to set the wallpaper if none is given

    * Use WOEID for yahoo, fetch it automatically if not given
     * REMOVED: YAHOOID from the config
    * Additional use of xml_grep (part of xml-twig-tools in Ubuntu) instead of 
      xmlstarlet because the latter refused to work with Yahoos woeid-API
